I participated in the iHeartRadio (my company's sister company) hackweek in July 2019. While I can't go in-depth on the team's project, it was great spending time with coworkers in a different environment and learning about other teams' projects.

Blog post about our experience [here](https://www.jelli.com/launchpad/why-is-everyone-talking-about-hackathons/), and a blog post by another colleague [here](https://tech.iheart.com/iheartradio-summer-hackweek-2019-d1e6b37bb692). I promise I didn't play pool and volleyball the whole time.
