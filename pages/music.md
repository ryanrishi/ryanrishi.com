# Music

### Senior Recital
As a music major, I was awarded the opportunity to put on a recital in my senior year. It composed of various musical elements including live looping marimba with [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/), percussion ensemble, _a cappella_, gamelan, and mallet solos.

### Percussion Covers
In college, I enjoyed arranging and recording popular songs played on keyboard percussion instruments.

### Recording
I've produced two albums. The first is Christmas In Claradise, which was a joint effort with the five _a cappella_ groups at Santa Clara University. You can read about it [here](/blog/2015-12-27-the-twelve-days-of-an-a-cappella-christmas-album).

The second is [Bellomy](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Tbpm70sMQ2aUwdsEieHn5?si=pucr00KFSq-X_hMGfvNRrA), an album of songs written by my band from college.
