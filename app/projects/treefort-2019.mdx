In March 2019, I presented at [Hackfort](https://www.treefortmusicfest.com/fort/hackfort/), part of the Treefort music festival in Boise, Idaho. My panel was on side projects and innovation, and how side projects foster a mindset of innovation that lends itself nicely to day-to-day work.

Here is a quote from the Q&A portion of the panel:
> For side projects, because you’re in full control, it’s easy to get lost in the idealist/perfectionist mentality. This is something that previously plagued me. In the process of rebuilding a website, I switched from Jekyll to Rails to Rails API + Ember to Node API + Ember and back to Jekyll. In hindsight I’m glad I got exposure to all of those technologies, but it also taught me that it doesn’t have to be perfect. Perfection is the enemy of progress.
>
> The flip side to that is to not get too caught up in the technology. The tech world moves at light speed (see: React / Angular / Angular.js / Vue / Ember), so anchoring yourself to one tech stack is a good way to become pigeonholed. Above all else, this is about building a product that someone can use&mdash; even if that someone is yourself. While exposure to the bleeding edge technologies is exciting and a worthy venture, it’s also healthy to take a step back and making sure you’re focusing on whatever your goal is for that project.
